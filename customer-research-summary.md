2. No case studies or detailed customer stories found
3. Social media (Instagram/Facebook) may have more customer information but wasn't accessible
4. No press releases or news articles found mentioning specific school installations

1. **Check Internal Records**: 
   - Sales database
   - Customer testimonials (if you have signed releases)
   - Installation photos with school branding visible

2. **Social Media Review**:
   - Instagram: @playerstallsports
   - Facebook: PlayerStall Sports Lockers
   - Look for tagged schools or tagged posts

3. **Contact Customers Directly**:
   - Reach out to past customers for permission to use their names/logos
   - Request logo files for testimonial pages

4. **Search Installation Photos**:
   - Review gallery images for visible school logos, team names, or branding
   - Check if any photos show school names on lockers or walls

### Next Steps

1. Review the gallery images more carefully for visible school branding
2. Check social media accounts for customer tags/mentions
3. Review internal customer database (if available)
4. Contact Estevan Bears for permission to use their logo/name as a customer reference
