Wood lockers, when properly cared for, outlast metal.

Do the math. Wood wins on total cost."

Wood or Metal Lockers? Here's What I Tell Every Athletic Director Starting Their First Project

After 30+ years making wood sports lockers, I've had this conversation thousands of times:

"Curt, should we go with wood or metal?"

Here's the honest truth I've learned:

DURABILITY: Wood wins. When properly cared for, wood lockers outlast metal by years. I've seen wood lockers still going strong after 15+ years. Metal? They're dented, rusted, and need replacing. The difference? Wood breathes. Metal doesn't.

COST: Yes, wood costs more upfront. But here's what most people don't calculate: Metal lockers need replacing every 8-10 years. Wood lockers last 15+ years (often longer). Do the math. Wood wins on total cost of ownership.

CULTURE: Walk into a locker room with wood lockers. Then walk into one with metal. One feels professional. Prestigious. One feels... industrial. Cold. Your players notice. Your recruits notice.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want storage → Metal works. If you want to build culture, attract recruits, and create a space that lasts → Wood is the answer.

After 30+ years, I've never had a coach regret choosing wood.

If you're planning your first locker room project, here's the honest truth I've learned from three decades in this business:

**DURABILITY REALITY**

Wood lockers, when properly cared for, outlast metal by years. I've seen wood lockers still going strong after 15+ years. Metal? They're dented, rusted, and need replacing.

The difference? Wood breathes. Metal doesn't.

**CULTURE REALITY**
